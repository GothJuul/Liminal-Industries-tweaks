This Fork adds a few recipes and stuff to make the progression feel a bit more seamless


  Current Features:
      -Recipe for slimeballs
      -recipe for cornflower (placeholder, for lack of better ideas, can be transmuted to other flower types)
      -that's it for now
      
  Planned Features:
      -A way to dismantle Tinker tools, making the rare husk drops actually worth something (broken script/causes crashes, no idea why. won't be included till i figure this out)
      -Some form transportation to make exploring and getting back home a little less of a chore, perhaps a random horse that noclips through the ceiling in certain rooms
      -Banana
      -Some alternative recipes for eidolon and botania because i have mixed feelings about the magic mods in this pack.
			-suol snad? (need to see how unbalanced it is)
